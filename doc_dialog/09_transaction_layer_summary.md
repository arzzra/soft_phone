# Transaction Layer Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Transaction Layer (Day 5 of Phase 1) with full RFC 3261 compliance.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. **Transaction Interfaces** (`interface.go`)
- Transaction states: Calling, Proceeding, Completed, Terminated, Trying, Confirmed
- Timer constants (A-K) with special handling for reliable transports
- Client and Server transaction interfaces
- Manager interface for transaction lifecycle

### 2. **Client Transaction** (`client.go`)
- Full FSM implementation for INVITE and non-INVITE transactions
- Timer management:
  - Timer A/E: Retransmission timers
  - Timer B/F: Transaction timeout
  - Timer D/K: Wait time in completed state
- Automatic ACK generation for error responses
- Cancel support with proper state validation
- Thread-safe operations with atomic state updates

### 3. **Server Transaction** (`server.go`)
- Separate FSM for INVITE and non-INVITE transactions
- Response caching for retransmissions
- Timer management:
  - Timer G: Response retransmission
  - Timer H: Wait for ACK
  - Timer I: Wait for ACK retransmits
  - Timer J: Wait for non-INVITE retransmits
- ACK handling with state transition to Confirmed
- Cleanup protection against double-close

### 4. **Transaction Manager** (`manager.go`)
- Transaction storage and retrieval
- Message routing (requests/responses/ACK)
- Automatic cleanup of terminated transactions
- Key generation using branch + method + direction
- Transport selection (currently defaults to UDP)

### 5. **Comprehensive Tests**
- Client transaction tests: Basic flow, error responses, retransmission, cancel
- Server transaction tests: Basic flow, ACK handling, retransmission
- Mock transport for testing with reliable/unreliable modes
- All tests passing with proper state transitions

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Atomic State Management**: Used atomic operations for thread-safe state updates
2. **Channel-based Communication**: Responses and ACKs delivered via channels
3. **Timer Zero for Reliable**: Immediate termination for reliable transports
4. **Cleanup Protection**: Added guards against double-close of channels
5. **Flexible Transport**: Mock transport supports both reliable and unreliable modes

## RFC 3261 Compliance

- ✅ Client transaction FSM (Section 17.1.1)
- ✅ Server transaction FSM (Section 17.2.1)
- ✅ All timer implementations (Section 17.1.1.2)
- ✅ ACK generation for INVITE errors
- ✅ Response retransmission handling
- ✅ Proper state transitions

## Integration Points

The Transaction Layer is now ready to be used by the Dialog Layer:
- Create transactions via Manager
- Monitor state changes via callbacks
- Receive responses/ACKs via channels
- Automatic cleanup on termination

## Next Steps

With the Transaction Layer complete, we're ready to implement:
1. Dialog Layer (Days 6-7) - Dialog state management, REFER support
2. Stack Layer (Day 8) - Coordination between all layers
3. Integration with existing packages
