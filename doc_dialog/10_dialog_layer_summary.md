# Dialog Layer Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Dialog Layer (Days 6-7 of Phase 1) with full RFC 3261 dialog management and RFC 3515 REFER support.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. **Dialog Interface** (`interface.go`)
- Dialog states: Init, Early, Confirmed, Terminated
- UAC/UAS role distinction
- REFER support with subscriptions
- Complete dialog management API

### 2. **Dialog Implementation** (`dialog.go`)
- Full dialog state machine
- Thread-safe operations with mutex protection
- CSeq management (separate for local/remote)
- Route set handling
- REFER implementation with async pattern:
  - `SendRefer()` - non-blocking send
  - `WaitRefer()` - blocking wait for response
- Subscription management for NOTIFY
- Proper tag handling for UAC/UAS roles

### 3. **Dialog Manager** (`manager.go`)
- Dialog storage and retrieval
- Message routing to appropriate dialogs
- Automatic re-keying when remote tag is learned
- Cleanup of terminated dialogs
- Thread-safe concurrent access

### 4. **Comprehensive Tests**
- Dialog creation and state transitions
- REFER/NOTIFY handling
- Route set management
- Manager message routing
- Remote tag updates and re-keying
- All tests passing (12/12)

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Dual Tag Management**: 
   - UAC: LocalTag = From tag, RemoteTag = To tag
   - UAS: LocalTag = To tag, RemoteTag = From tag

2. **Dynamic Re-keying**: When remote tag is learned from response, dialog is re-keyed in manager storage

3. **Async REFER Pattern**: Two-phase approach allows timeout control and cancellation

4. **State Machine**: Clear state transitions with callbacks for monitoring

5. **Thread Safety**: All shared state protected with appropriate synchronization

## RFC Compliance

- ✅ RFC 3261 Dialog Management (Section 12)
- ✅ Dialog state machine (Init → Early → Confirmed → Terminated)
- ✅ Tag handling and dialog identification
- ✅ Route set construction from Record-Route
- ✅ CSeq tracking (separate for each direction)
- ✅ RFC 3515 REFER method support
- ✅ Subscription handling for NOTIFY

## Integration Points

The Dialog Layer integrates with:
- **Transaction Layer**: Uses transaction manager for message transport
- **Message Layer**: Uses message types and builders
- **Application Layer**: Provides high-level dialog API

## Bug Fixes During Implementation

1. **Remote Tag Update**: Fixed issue where remote tag wasn't updated when transitioning from Early to Confirmed state
2. **Contact Header**: Added required Contact header for REFER requests
3. **Dialog Re-keying**: Properly implemented dialog re-keying when remote tag is learned

## Next Steps

With Transport, Message, Transaction, and Dialog layers complete, the remaining work includes:
1. Stack Layer (Day 8) - Coordination between all layers
2. Integration with existing RTP/Media packages
3. Complete replacement of sipgo dependency
